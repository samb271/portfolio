            Currently building Shepherd, a computer vision pipeline and world modeling system that enables our robot to understand and reason about its environment. 
            The system integrates state-of-the-art models, including CLIP, FastSAM, YOLOWorld, BLIP, and LLama. 
            Future capabilities will include RL-based self-navigation, with plans to compete in the 2025 European Robotics Hackathon (Enrich) in Austria.<br><br>
            Designed and implemented a pose detection algorithm to enable visual command interpretation. Built on a fine-tuned YOLOv8 with a custom classification head, 
            the algorithm achieved 99% accuracy and competed in the 2024 European Land Robot Trial in Germany. This marked the clubâ€™s 
            first in-house implementation of artificial intelligence.
